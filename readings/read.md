Tips for Data Visualization (Part III)

Understanding data relationships is important to the data visualization process. Common data relationships are listed below:

ðŸ‘‰ Time Series - tracks changes in values of a metric over time
ðŸ‘‰ Nominal Comparison - compares quantitative values of subcategories
ðŸ‘‰ Correlation - data with two or more valriables that may have a positive or negative correlation to each other
ðŸ‘‰ Part-to-Whole-Relationships - subset of data compared to the larger whole
ðŸ‘‰ Distribution - shows data distribution around a central value
ðŸ‘‰ Deviation - shows how data points relate to each other, to see how far any given point is from the mean
ðŸ‘‰ Ranking - shows how two or more values compare to each other in relative magnitude
