If you're concerned about not having enough practice in honing your #DataScience and #MachineLearning skills then here are some things you can do on Kaggle:

1. Learn - https://lnkd.in/gghHUH2
Kaggle has their own education track where you can start learning the foundations. The course includes: 
- Machine Learning
- Python
- Data Visualization 
- SQL
- R
- Deep Learning

2. Kernels - https://lnkd.in/e_VcNpk
There's no doubt that one of Kaggle's biggest features is its access to user's Kernels/Notebooks. You literally have a person's documentation and code right in front of you. My advice is for you to choose a problem you want to learn (classification, regression, EDA, etc..) and find a top-voted Kernel for you to study off from. 

3. Competitions - https://lnkd.in/epb9c8N
This is a must for those that are really interested in ML. Kaggle has many competitions for you to choose from and it's great practice for trying out different models & improve your scores. My tip for you is to look at the Kenerls section in the competition you're interested in. Many people upload their kernels with base models you can use and optimize off from. 

4. Datasets - https://lnkd.in/gZjpxtX
There are thousands of datasets you can download here all from different domains!
