This weekend, we're going to cover one of the latest theory by the most famous Neural Network researcher - Dr. Geoff Hinton.
*** Fast.ai Part 1***
Lesson 7 : Recap (Not Confirmed)

*** Capsule Networks ***
For those of you who aren't aware of it, fret not.
This weekend we're going to learn the important concept behind Capsules as well as implement them from scratch in PyTorch.

So we encourage you to bring a clear mind this weekend because you're going to learning the cutting-edge and would probably be applying it on your own Computer Vision tasks.

*** Discussion and Transfer Learning ***
Wouldn't it be cool if we all could bring something little to the table and learn from everybody else's experience?
To change the dynamics of our future meetups, we're going to divide you into groups to do fun activities together.
